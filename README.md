# NotchRuler
A 3D Printed guide for filing notches for SSBM on GCC

Credit to Kadano for providing his notching diagrams that I referenced while modelling this 3D File.
Credit to Lum for adding the cross brace supports to prevent the legs snapping.

It doesn't get you all the way there but should help get you close, which is good enough when calibrating on a PhobGCC.
Notching on OEM is much harder this file is really intended to get you started notching for phob, notching for OEM GCC
is significantly harder.

I'll link my diamond files I use from AliExpress
the obtuse angle file for getting the basic shapes
the round file for rounding out the gates
the acute triangle file for getting into corners and fixing any mistakes

Definitely look at other notchers work to get an idea for how they should look/feel. You are more than welcome to leave feedback
this is just a method that has worked well for me. If you are able to improve on these files, please do so and share the knowledge.

Cheers
